A word frequency counter is an algorithm used to count how often each word appears in a given text. It typically involves these steps:

Preprocess the text (convert to lowercase, remove punctuation).
Split the text into words (tokenization).
Count the occurrences of each word using a data structure like a hash map or dictionary.
The most common data structure for this task is a hash map (or Counter in Python), where each key is a word and the value is its frequency. This allows for efficient counting in O(n) time, where n is the number of words.

Applications include text analysis, search engines, and spam detection.
